This projected started as a attempt to reproduce something I did as a kid on a C64. Many yaers ago I created used the C64 Raster interrupt hook to run some assembler code that would bounce some sprites around the screen. Because the code was run by a Raster interrupt it would always be running in the background and the sprites would always be onscreen bouncing around even when another program was running.

After starting this project however I decided to implement sprite collisions. From that point I got totally side tracked modelling elasitc collisions, ideal gassed and gravity.

This project uses SVG with React. The SVG elements are using the normal React render and hence the virtual dom. It is interesting to see how well the virtual dom handles all the updates and the simulations perform surprising well for this technology.
